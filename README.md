### Example 1: AutoGen Analytics on Real Estate Data

This example illustrates AutoGen's ability to analyze a CSV file containing real estate data. The process involves:

- Reading and understanding the file structure.
- Identifying potential KPIs based on header names and data types.
- Generating a Python script to calculate industry-specific KPIs and plotting the results.

### Example 2: Vercel and Supabase Vector DB with OpenAI and LLMs

A demonstration of an out-of-the-box solution combining Vercel, Supabase as a vector DB, and OpenAIâ€™s LLMs:

- Features a containerized app running locally.
- User interaction with a chat interface showcasing AI's dynamic response capabilities.
- Illustrates how embeddings are added and indexed in the vector DB, enabling the AI to reference updated information without retraining.
